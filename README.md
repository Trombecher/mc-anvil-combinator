# Minecraft Anvil Combinator

Available under https://trombecher.github.io/mc-anvil-combinator/dist/.

It calculates the cheapest way to combine a set of items together. This tool is build with [azero](https://github.com/Trombecher/azero) (frontend framework) and mceb.js (not yet published) (backend, enchanted books calculator).

I used [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the packet manager, as well as [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for building.
